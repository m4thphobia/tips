## Pytorch workflow
1: data (prepare and load)
    torchvision.transforms
    torch.utils.data.Dataset
    torch.utils.data.DataLoader
2: build model
    #model, loss function
    torch.nn
    torch.nn.Module
    torchvision.models
    #optimizer
    torch.optim
3: fitting the model to data
4: making predictions and evaluating a model
    torch.metrics
5: Improve through experimentation
    torch.utils.tensorboard
6: saving and loading a model

Machine learning is a game of two parts:
1: Get data into a numerical representation.
2: Build a model to learn patterns in that numerical representation.

## Pytorch model building essentials
1: torch.nn - contains all of the buildings for computational graphs
2: torch.nn.Parameter - what parameters should our model try and learn, often a Pytorch layer from torch.nn will set these for us
3: torch.nn.Module - the base class for all neural network modules. If you subclass it, you should overwite forward()
4: torch.optim - this where the optimizers inPytorch live, they will help with gradient descent
5: def forward() - All nn.Module subclasses require you to overwrite forward()
6: torch.utils.data.Dataset
7: torch.utils.data.Dataloader

## Things we need to train(move from some random parameters to the unknown parameter, from a poor representation of the data to a better representation of th data)
Loss function: A function to measure how wrong your model's predictions are to the ideal outputs
Optimizer: Takes into account the loss of a model and adjust the model's parameters
